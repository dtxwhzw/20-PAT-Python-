    "## 1015 Reversible Primes (20point(s))\n",
    "A reversible prime in any number system is a prime whose \"reverse\" in that number system is also a prime. For example in the decimal system 73 is a reversible prime because its reverse 37 is also a prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now given any two positive integers N (<$10^{5}$) and D (1<D≤10), you are supposed to tell if N is a reversible prime with radix D.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Specification:\n",
    "The input file consists of several test cases. Each case occupies a line which contains two integers N and D. The input is finished by a negative N.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Specification:\n",
    "For each test case, print in one line Yes if N is a reversible prime with radix D, or No if not.\n",
